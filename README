Anagopos 3D: A Reduction Graph Visualizer for Term Rewriting and λ-Calculus

Introduction
------------

Anagopos 3D can be used to visualize reduction graphs from term rewriting and
λ-calculus. The tool derives from the Anagopos visualization tool [1] and
is similarly distributed under the GNU General Public License. Contrary to
Anagopos, which is based on GraphViz, graph drawing in Anagopos 3D depends on
capabilities of UbiGraph. UbiGraph does 3D layout of graphs based on a force-
directed algorithm, where GraphViz is limited to 2D layouts.

The code-base of the tool also partially derives from Anagopos, whose source
code can be found at:

  http://code.google.com/p/anagopos/

Usage
-----

To use the tool a copy of UbiGraph is required, which can be downloaded from

  http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/

After starting the UbiGraph server software (ubigraph_server), Anagopos 3D can
be invoked with:

  python anagopos3d.py

The operation of the tool is similar to that of Anagopos, whose usage is
described in [1]. Remark that not all functionality from Anapopos is present:
The current tool only supports one graph drawing algorithm and one color scheme.
Moreover, only the TPDB format for TRS descriptions is supported. Finally, part
of the functionality, such as resetting the graph layout, is taken over by
UbiGraph (see also the UbiGraph documentation).

Possible Future Extensions
--------------------------

* The code currently makes use of a number of global variables, this should
  be cleaned-up.
* Ensure the interface does no "lock-up" during foward and backward operations.
* UbiGraph does not seem to be supported any longer. Hence, alternative 3D
  3D graph drawing libraries should be considered.
